It is a simple Python calculator application built using the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
The purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on experience in creating a GUI application using Tkinter and to learn the fundamentals of GUI programming, including creating widgets, handling events, and updating the display.
This project's main challenge is processing user input and executing the proper arithmetic operation in response to a button press. 
This entails analyzing the mathematical expression, parsing the input string, and showing the outcome. 
Furthermore, the project attempts to gracefully handle mistakes by providing an error message rather than crashing the program, for example, when handling syntax problems or division by zero.
